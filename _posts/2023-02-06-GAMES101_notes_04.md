## Lecture 13 Ray Tracing 1(Whitted-Style Ray Tracing)

### Why Ray Tracing

- Rasterization couldn't handle __global__ effects well
  - (soft) shadows
  - especially when the light bounces __more than once__
- Rasterization is fast, but quality is relatively low
- Ray tracing is accurate, but is very slow
  - Rasterization: real-time, ray tracing: offline
  - ~10K CPU core hours to render one frame in production

### Basic Ray Tracing Algorithm

Three ideas about light rays

1. Light travels in straight lines(though this is wrong)
2. Light rays do not "collide" with each other if they cross(though this is still wrong)
3. Light rays travel from the light sources to the eye(but the physics is invariant under path reversal - reciprocity)

#### Ray Casting

1. Generate an image by __casting one ray per pixel__
2. Check for shadows by __sending a ray to the light__

#### Recursive(Whitted-Style) Ray Tracing

- 考虑每个从眼睛出发的光线到每个物体处发生的折射和反射的结果；
- 对于每个折射和反射的结果，分别计算其到光源的点的着色结果，加总后得到最后的着色值
- 每次折射后的结果都会发生一定的能量损耗

### Ray-Surface Intersection

Ray is defined by its origin and a direction vector

$$
    \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{o} + t\mathbf{d}, \quad 0 \le t < \infty
$$

#### Ray Intersection With Sphere

$$
    \mathrm{Ray: } \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{o} + t\mathbf{d}, \quad \\
    \mathrm{Sphere: } \mathbf{p} : (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{c})^2 - R^2 = 0
$$

#### Ray Intersection With Implicit Surface

$$
    \mathrm{Ray: }\quad \mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{o} + t\mathbf{d}, \quad \\
    \mathrm{General\ implicit\ surface: }\quad \mathbf{p} : f(\mathbf{p}) = 0\\
    \mathrm{Substitute\ ray\ equation: }\quad f(\mathbf{o} + t\mathbf{d}) = 0
$$

#### Ray Intersection With Triangle Mesh

Why?

- Rendering: visibility, shadows, lighting
- Geometry: inside/outside test

How?

- Simple idea: just intersect ray with each triangle
- Simple, but slow(acceleration? -- later)
- Note: can have 0, 1 intersections(ignoring multiple intersections)

#### Ray Intersection With Triangle

Triangle is in a plane

- Ray-plane intersection
- Test if hit point is inside triangle

Plane is defined by normal vector and a point on plane

$$
    \mathbf{p}: (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{p}')\cdot\mathbf{N} = 0\qquad
    ax + by + cz + d = 0
$$

#### Moller Trumbore Algorithm

A fast approach, giving barycentric coordinate directly

Derivation in the discussion section!

$$
    \mathbf{O} + t\mathbf{D} = (1 - b_1 - b_2)\mathbf{P}_0 + b_1 \mathbf{P}_1 + b_2\mathbf{P}_2
$$

### Accelerating Ray-Surface Intersection

Simple ray-scene intersection

- Exhaustively test ray-intersection with every object
- Find the closest hit(with minimum t)

#### Bounding Volumes

Quick way to avoid intersections: bound complex object with a simple volume

- Object is fully contained in the volume
- If it doesn't hit the volume, it doesn't hit the object
- So test BVol first, then test object if it hits

Ray-Intersection with Box

- Understanding: box is the intersection of 3 pairs of slabs
- Specifically, we often use an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box(AABB)

Key ideas

- The ray enters the box only when it enters all pairs of slabs
- The ray exits the bos as long as it exits any pair of slabs

具体操作方法：

- 考虑光线通过分别通过每个方向的两个平面的时间$t_{\min},\ t_{\max}$
- 如果进入时间的最大值小于射出时间的最小值，则说明光线同包围盒有交点
- 对于时间为负值的情况
  - 如果进入时间为负，离开时间为正，则可以说明光源在盒中；
  - 如果离开时间为负，说明盒子沿光路在光源后面
- In summary, ray and AABB intersect iff
  - $t_{enter} < t_{exit}\ \mathrm{and}\ t_{exit} \ge 0$

- Learning to use an editor is basically a matter of learning finger habits. Once you're at this point, you're home. You can become creative with Emacs and start thinking about how to put its features to work for you. Good finger habits can make you an inredibly fast typist, and reaching from keyboard to mouse only slos you down.

## Lesson03

- Happiness is not negation of Unhappiness.

Getting rid of the negative doesn't guarantee us the positive. So instead of focusing on the weakness, focusing on the strengths we have. When we cultivate the positive, we're essentially focusing on prevention(from the negative).

It was found that the most effective way of dealing with the phenomenon of depression was actually to cultivate the positive, to cultivate personal strengths, to cultivate and identify one's passions. To ask a question such as what is meaningful to me in my life, what's my purpose, why I am here.

- Cultivating capacity.

Positive psychology serves a new model(health mode). The conventional model thinks that the reason why a person is sick is that he is ill, and taking away the illness leads to being healthy. The positive psychology model thinks that the reason a person is sick is that there is not enough health in his life and he isn't pursuing those things that make him healthy.

- The five basic premises of the course

  - Applications of textures(写在第九讲笔记最后)
- Introduction to geometry
  - Examples of geometry
  - Various representations of geometry

### Introduction to geometry

#### Many Ways to Represent Geometry

几何的显式表示和隐式表示

- Implicit
  - algebraic surface
  - level sets
  - distance functions
  - ...
- Explicit
  - point cloud
  - polygon mesh
  - subdivision, NURBS
  - ...

Each choice best suited to a different task/type of geometry

"Implicit" Representations of Geometry

- Based on classifying points
  - Point satisfy some specified relationship
- Sampling can be hard
- Inside/Outside tests is easy

"Explicit" Representations of Geometry

- All points are __given directly__ or __via parameter mapping__
- Sampling is easy
- Inside/Outside Test Hard

Conclusion: __Bset representation depends on the task.__

More Implicit representations in Computer Graphics

- Algebraic Surfaces 
  - 非常不直观，且无法处理复杂几何结构
- Constructive Solid Geometry(CSG)
  - 通过对简单几何体进行布尔运算
  - 可以得到复杂几何结构的表示
- Distance Functions
  - Instead of Booleans, gradually blend surfaces together using Distance functions:
  - Giving minimum distance(could be signed distance) from anywhere to object
- Level Set Method
  - Closed-form equation are hard to describe complex shapes
  - Alternative: store a grid of values approximating function
  - Surface is found where interpolated values equal zero
  - Provides such more explicit control over shape(like a texture)
- Fractals 分形
  - Exhibit self-similarity, detail at all scales
  - "Language" for describing natural phenomena
  - Hard to control shape

#### Implicit Representations - Pros & Cons

- Pros:
  - compact description(e.g., a function)
  - certain queries easy(inside object, distance to surface)
  - good for ray-to-surface intersection(more later)
  - for simple shapes, exact description / no sampling error
  - easy to handle changes in topology(e.g., fluid)
- Cons:
  - difficult ot model complex shapes

#### Explicit Representations in Computer Graphics(later)

How can I become happier?

## Lecture01 Introduction

The Goal of this course is to chip away the "excess stone" covered on ourselves and to help us to realize our potential, "David".

This course will focus on the simplicity on the other side of complexity, not the straightforward complicity. And what you need to do is to apply what you have learned into life, the behaviors. It matters that what you do differs from that before.

## Lecture02 Why Positive Psychology?
- Questions create reality. Only look at deficiency will make good things not visible.
  -  Appreciate what is good inside me.
- Being happy is not just a negation of depression and anxiety.
- Learn how to prevent from depression.

Resilience, and the conponents: Optimisim, Faith and a sense of meaning, Prosocial behavior, Focusing on strengths, Set goals, A role model and Social support.
